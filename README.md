# **Python Project for Data Science â€“ Stock Price Analysis**  

## **Project Overview**  
This repository meant to contain a basic data analysis project for the course **"Python Project for Data Science"** offered by **IBM**. However, I am not sure that I am legally allowed to upload it. Thus, the uploaded files are empty. The project focuses on retrieving financial data using web scraping and transforming it into a structured format for analysis.  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to:  
- Extract stock price and revenue data for **Tesla** and **GameStop** using web scraping  
- Store the data in a **pandas DataFrame** for easy manipulation  
- Visualize the data using the **graphing function provided by the course**  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** for data manipulation and visualization  
- **Pandas** for handling tabular data  
- **Web scraping** techniques for data extraction  
- **Matplotlib** (or another graphing tool) for visual representation  

## **How It Works**  
1. Web scraping is used to collect stock price and revenue data for Tesla and GameStop  
2. The extracted data is converted into a pandas DataFrame  
3. The built-in graphing function from the course is used to visualize the trends  

## **Getting Started**  
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (**pandas**, **requests**, **matplotlib**, etc.). Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the notebook or script.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project provides a beginner-friendly approach to **data collection, manipulation, and visualization**, offering hands-on experience in financial data analysis.
